        I graduated from The University of New South Wales with a bachelor's degree 
        in Computer Science, where I maintained a solid academic record and was listed 
        on the Dean's Honours List every year. With my excellent problem-solving skills 
        and passion for coding, I have attended multiple coding competitions ranging 
        from ICPC to university hackathons.<br/><br/>

        Throughout my career, I have developed a wide range of skill sets including expertise 
        in C++ and Python, as well as experience in web app, socket, AI, and OS kernal programming, 
        as well as cyber security. Currently, I work as a software developer at Eclipse Trading, 
        a market-making trading company, where I use C++ on a daily basis and have further developed 
        my knowledge of low latency programming.
